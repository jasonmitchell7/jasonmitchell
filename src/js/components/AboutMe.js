                    Converging creativity with coding is my passion. I have a creative background in film and studied
                    computer science.

                    I've had a love for programming since I was a young child. This is largely due to my father, who used
                    my parent's wedding money to buy a Macintosh IIfx. A few years later, I fell in love with an online
                    game, but could not afford to pay the monthly subscription fee. I ended up contributing to a
                    server-side emulator for the game. This included writing tutorials for C# development specific to use
                    with the emulator.

                    I love when people doubt me as it simply provides an opportunity to prove them wrong. I was told when I
                    was 14 that I had a social phobia and that this was something that could not be overcome. Shortly
                    thereafter, I was registered for an acting class. Now I love talking to people and in front of people.
