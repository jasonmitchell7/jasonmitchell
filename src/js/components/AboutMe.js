                    Converging creativity with coding is my passion. I have a creative background in film and an
                    education in computer science. The vast areas of concern while creating a piece of software is
                    something I love. From trying to figure out the best approach for time and space efficiency, to
                    meeting project deadlines and lastly, creating an elegant and intuitive user experience. The
                    details are important. Hamburger menus that animate into an "X" make me happy.

                    While pursuing my degree at the University of Minnesota, I created a social media app. This used
                    Swift for the front end (iOS) and Ruby On Rails for the backend API. This was an incredible
                    learning experience. Leveraging the power of both the AVFoundation and CoreImage frameworks allowed
                    me to implement face tracking and a filter system. Content was uploaded to an Amazon AWS S3 server.
                    I also used other Amazon AWS services during this experience, which included RDS and EC3. These
                    were deployed using a docker container. Ultimately, I learned that I love the coding a creating
                    parts of building a larger app, but not the business aspects. Trying secure capital is not
                    something I wish to do again, and this project taught me that I am a person that is looking for
                    more security in my career.

                    Also during my schooling I was an intern at Infinite Campus. This was a wonderful experience with
                    many great people. It gave me great insight into how a larger software operates. I was able to
                    join an agile team for multiple projects, which ranged from updating the backend REST API (Java)
                    to making significant UI changes while adding new features. I also got to spend a great amount of
                    time working on tests and automation.

                    I believe that these experiences make me a very strong candidate for a junior software engineer
                    or full stack developer position.
